    <h1>Interesting Facts About Honeybees</h1>
    <p>Honeybees communicate with one another by dancing. A bee's dance can tell its hive mates where to find food.</p>
    <p>Honeybees are the only insect that produces food eaten by humans.</p>
    <p>Beehives are composed of hexagon-shaped cells and can hold around 20,000 to 80,000 bees.</p>
    <p>The average worker bee lives for just five to six weeks. During this time, they'll produce about 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey.</p>
    <p>Honeybees fly at a speed of around 15 miles per hour and beat their wings 200 times per second!</p>
